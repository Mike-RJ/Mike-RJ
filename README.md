Welcome to my profile! I'm an AWS Cloud Engineer for Leaven NZ. Most of my work is private, but feel free to browse through my public repositories. 

I write a technical blog on my GitHub pages ([mike-rj.github.io](https://mike-rj.github.io)) where I cover topics related to Cloud and DevOps.  

Lastly, if you're wondering what my profile photo is - I generated it using the [Midjourney Bot](https://www.midjourney.com).
