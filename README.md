Lifelong learner and currently a recovering noob.  I occasionally write articles on my blog ([https://kiwimike.me](https://kiwimike.me)). 

I'm working on making more of my private projects public. 

Also currently progressing through [boot.dev](https://boot.dev), you can find me there under the @kiwimike handle. 

## My public projects:
- [kiwimike.k8s](https://github.com/Mike-RJ/kiwimike.k8s) | An ansible collection that currently can bootstrap nodes and deploy kubernetes with the cilium CNI, looking to develop more management roles.
- [spell_bot](https://github.com/Mike-RJ/spell_bot) | A discord bot using nextcord that allows you to cast spells at other server members, using langchain, ollama and deployed via Docker-Compose.

## My stats are pretty rubbish, but here's to an improvement in 2025:
